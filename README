Hello all!

This is my Second Assignment, my question is: How to design the functions of characters (include Player and Enemy)?
you could:
1. Open the PDF and see the description.
2. Download the Demo and try it.
3. Download the Project file and open it in Unity to see the specific parts which interset you!

Here is the link:

Project_file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JSnN2HmohxO2NzmRh7u3umgBOaW_dymK/view?usp=sharing

Note: the Project file contains all content from assignment_1 to assignment_4, so just download it once is enough.
